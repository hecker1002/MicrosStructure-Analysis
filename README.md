## Microstructure Analysis using Deep Learning Approach 

TO predict the stress-strain curve of a Cu-Ag alloy , we used an intutive technique of splitting the images and  keeping the stress curve same ( assuming isotropic material ) and then trained 2 custom CNN
models , first using a data extracted Volume fraction and second without volume fraction and both the results have been compiled inside the JUpyter Notebook .
